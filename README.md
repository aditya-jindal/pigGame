# PIG-Game 
A dice game that is played by 2 players competing against each other 

## GAME RULES 

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

Note: Since coding this project, I have learnt a far more efficient coding approach. But I'm leaving this code as it is to prove uniqueness.
